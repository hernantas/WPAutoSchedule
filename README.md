Wordpress plugin to automatically set your post schedule.

== Description ==

The purpose of this plugin is for automatically set the scheduled date just with one click. This is useful since it not that convenient to set schedule in WordPress. The plugin can set the date (including the month and the year) & time (hour & minutes) automatically and can be changed from the settings page.

This plugin works by adding a button in the post editor page, but this button only shows for the drafted post to avoid cluttering the editor page. When the button is clicked, the plugin will find the date that is available (have a less scheduled post than the limit). If there is some date that available, the plugin will assign the nearest available future date.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Settings->Auto Schedule screen to configure the plugin (or skip this one if want to use the default)
4. Start creating a new post or edit the draft.
